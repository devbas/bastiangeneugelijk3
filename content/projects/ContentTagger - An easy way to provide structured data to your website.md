### ðŸ¤” Problem

I work a lot with SEO and lately I got frustrated because of all the different formats that are required to support rich data snippets for Google, Facebook etcetera. But then I came across a TED talk about linked data:

{{< youtube OM6XIICm_qo >}}

This was exactly what I wanted. But the right tags with domain classes etcetera where kinda hard to structure. So here comes the solution.

### ðŸ›  Solution

ContentTagger automatically shows you the 'child' attributes from a chosen domain or range attribute so it becomes more easy to select something. On top of that I'm able to pass a link with the code to Google Structured Data Developer console and Facebook Graph, so easy testing! In the future I want to add more schemas (currently only schema.org) and create a library which you can use to query linked data yourself with SparQL.
