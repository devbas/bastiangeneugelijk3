#### The current user experience of public transport planning is not optimized for use on-the-go. Common solutions are limited to planning from a static location, such as train stations or addresses. This approach assumes that passengers plan their journey beforehand and does not take into account possible disruptions. The planned route is so to speak "static".

&nbsp;

To support passengers on their planned journey during disruptions, I created a rough classification algorithm that attempts to find the vehicle the passenger is aboard of. The input for classification is the current passenger coordinates and the current coordinates of all active public transport vehicles in The Netherlands. As soon as we know with which vehicle the passenger is traveling, we can check if the vehicle's route is disrupted and what consequence this has for the passenger.
