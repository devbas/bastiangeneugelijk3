title: Designing a system for Triplet Verification and Extraction by Human Computation through a User-Centered Approach.
date: 2018-07-01
draft: false
summary: Triplets (subject -> predicate/relation -> object) often define a common understanding of the meaning of information. This enables sharing and reuse of data. Triplet extraction by human computation frequently requires domain experts and can be considered a tedious and repetitive task. To overcome these limitations, I developed a *game with a purpose* to make the task of triplet verification and extraction entertaining.
