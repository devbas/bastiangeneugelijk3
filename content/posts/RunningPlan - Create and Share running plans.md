[I love to run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2642347). After a few years of running whenever I felt to, two years ago my runs started to be a bit more on schedule to have a more consistent effort and less risk on overtraining. To make this a bit easier, I usually create a running schedule in Google Sheets, print it out and hang it on my fridge. However, due to the Covid-19 circumstances I did not have access to a printer anymore. Besides, people started to ask me for basic running schedules now that all gyms were closed.

This is the reason I created [runningplan.co](https://runningplan.co), an easy way to create and share running plans. RunningPlan supports Calendar export for when I don't have access to a printer.

For now, its a very basic application, made with React, Node and a MySQL database.
